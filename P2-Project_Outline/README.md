## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Overview: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

    My project is an application that would allow people to find other users who are interested in traveling to a desired place. This would be potentially be both a local and global application. The app would allow a user to sign in, pick certain places that they would like to visit, and then be connected with someone else (a friend, or another user) who would like to visit the same place.
    
    People would find this app useful because they will be able to find travel buddies. Traveling and exploration are great for health, happiness, and overall well-being. However, some people might be afraid to travel to a new destination, or they may might not know who else would want to go with them. Traveling with friends or companions is especially important because it can create positive, lifelong memories. 
    
    On a local scale, this could be visiting an historic site around St. Louis, or visiting a well-known restaurant or museum. On a global scale, this could be traveling to a special city in a foreign country.  
    
    Ideation of this project began when my wife and I were discussing where to visit, and who we could potentially go with. We love to travel and find new places and thought this would be a great way to get started planning out trips. Our philisophy is that general happiness and healthy living is paramount to a full and successful life, and this app would help us achieve that purpose.
